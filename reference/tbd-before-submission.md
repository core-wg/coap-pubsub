# Final Pass

- **Introduction**
    - [x] Terminology. Since we made the `topic_data_uri` part of the topic configuration, we implicitly made the term `topic` = `topic-configuration` . Should I remove the term topic-configuration and just `topic` or say that they are used as synonyms in the document?
        - CB: keep word topic for the abstract concept. "Topic resource", "Topic Data Resource".
        - CB,MT: change title: "A publish-subscribe architecture for the Constrained....", and abstract, and many other places
    - [x] Architecture and Managing Topics
- **Pubsub topics**
    - Configuration properties (topic_resource)
        - [ ] 'topic_name' (human readable field (e.g. "room2")), 'application identifier' (e.g., uuid), 'topic_data_uri', 'rt', 'target attributes' of data resource (including media type, via ct; media types available for patch)
    - Status properties
        - [ ] Default values. 
        - CB: Mention that the names used are not cast in stone and are just examples. Discovery is still needed.
        - MT, CB: maybe merged both conf and status sections. Add a 'expiration date' property, 'max-client'
- **Discovery and Configuration**
    - Discovery
        - [x] broker
        - [x] topic
    - Topic Collection interactions
        - [ ] Fix examples
        - [x] get all
        - [ ] fetch
            - MT,CB: Mostly "selection" = selecting a subset of the entries in the collection
                - ... WHERE ...
            - JJ: "Retrieve links to topic-data collection resources whose property X has a value that matches with the specified one
            - [ ] move to this section 'conf_filter' (part of the search, not of the resource itself)
        - [x] post/create
    - Topic Resource interactions
        - Topic Resource = Topic configuration plus other information on a topic
        - [ ] Fix examples
        - [x] get
        - [x] fetch [projection? ]
            - CB: Mostly "projection" = selecting a subset of the properties 
                SELECT foo, bar FROM ...
            JJ: "Retrieve topics that are matching the request property array."
        - [x] update (put, (i)patch)
            - [ ] ipatch
        - CB: need media type for this.
        - MT: Check oscore gm-admin example.
        - [x] delete
- **Using pubsub**
    - Topic data Resource interactions
        - Resource used to exchange data in this topic
    - [x] Pubs sub general process
    - [x] Topic Lifecycle
    - [ ] Topic data interaction image 2.7
    - [ ] Fix examples
    - CB: Senml, IPSO bare data
    - [x] Publish
    - [x] Subscribe
    - [ ] Unsubscribe. Maybe a bit thin. Missing example.
    - [ ] Delete. Maybe a bit thin. Missing example
        - [ ] send 404s to all subs (show example, no new content)
    - [x] Read latest data
- **Support Sections**
    - [ ] Remove Section: Uri Templates (empty)
    - [ ] Pubsub Parameters (need to check)
    - [ ] Security Considerations (empty)
    - [ ] IANA -> TBD for now (need to check)
