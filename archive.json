This resource will store published representations until the subscriber can retrieve or accept them. \r\n\r\nThe subscriber may use GET to return the representation of the queueing resource, receiving a list of links to published representations which may then be fetched using GET. The subscriber would be responsible for removing the representations it has fetched.\r\n\r\nThis enables sleepy subscribers and subscribers behind NAT firewalls to receive notifications without data loss. \r\n\r\nWe may also provide a resource that may be observed which returns and removes representations from the queue, in published order, using GET or Observe. Using GET, the broker would return \"no data\" upon fetches to an empty queue.\r\n\r\nA sleepy subscriber could wake up, subscribe, receive notifications, unsubscribe, and sleep again.\r\n\r\nWe may also provide a means for the subscriber to request a push or \"web callback\" using PUT or POST to update a resource on the subscriber upon notifications.\r\n\r\nWe could keep \"simple pubsub\" as it is, and allow queueing pubsub as an optional feature for enhanced QoS, sleepy subscribers, etc.\r\n",

One issue with Max-age is that it only applies to responses, and we need to convey the data lifetime on publish. We could use a uri-query option (e.g. \"dlt\") or a new header option for publish-max-age. Without this, the default Max-Age of 60 seconds would be required.

I realized I missunderstood the request \"cached message\" to be related to caching and freshness in the CoAP sense.  Topics are just links to CoAP resources hosted by a server. \r\nAFAIK when the broker is hosting the topic_data as well, it obviously needs to provide a resource representation when requested. \r\nHowever if the broker is just an \"exchange point for millions of devices\", that would mean that the topic_data resource is hosted elsewhere. When a subscriber subscribes to a topic in that context, the broker does not mediate in that.\r\n\r\nhttps://core-wg.github.io/coap-pubsub/ps-rev/draft-ietf-core-coap-pubsub.html#name-topic-data-interactions\r\n\r\n**OLD COMMENT**\r\nThe current version does not specify anything new in relation to caching freshness so the same logic as that for CoAP and CoAP Observe will apply. \r\n\r\nThe default Max-Age Option value is 60 in CoAP but that can be modified to cater to different deployment scenarios. If an origin server (i.e., origin server for the topic_data resource) wishes to prevent caching, it MUST explicitly include a Max-Age Option with a value of zero seconds.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7252#section-5.6\r\nhttps://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7641.html#section-3.3\r\n",

The current spec does not mandate for the topics to be hierarchically organized within the same broker, the path is a URL to a resource, unlike the MQTT topic structure.\r\n\r\nThe issue is at least twofold:\r\n\r\n### 1. Finding all topic_data URLs\r\n\r\nI htink this part is solved, there are many ways to find the topic resources and if your broker had a specific hierarchy you could design wildcards. For example a collection with some topics under it on a predefined path like `/ps` and under it the topic data under another predefined path like `/ps/data` could be used to set wildcard subscription to all topic_data resources. Another mechanism would be to use FETCH  with \"resource_type\" : \"core.ps.data\" , you would get a series of topic_data URIs.\r\n\r\nAs @mattaylor points out, you can also subscribe to the collection resource itself `/ps` with `rt=core.ps.data` and `obs` to get notified of new topic_data resources.\r\n\r\nThe usual discovery mechanisms apply https://core-wg.github.io/coap-pubsub/ps-rev/draft-ietf-core-coap-pubsub.html#name-discovery \r\n\r\n### 2. Subscribing to them in one single message\r\n\r\nAssuming that under the topic collectiong there are 100 resources like ps/data/<blabla> (they can also be labeled with rt=core.ps.data). How does a client observe all of them with one GET message?\r\n\r\nThis part that is not there yet. You could craft specific FETCH + obs messages that contain topic data URIs and subscribe to them in one go. \r\n\r\n@cabo for example mentions these two potential payloads:\r\n`{ match: \u201c/my/path/*\u201d }` or `{ prefix: \u201c/my/path/\u201c }`",

One-shot publication and topic creation.\r\n\r\nMy approach to do this would be:\r\n\r\n1. Making sure that topic-data path can be created/selected by the client. Which is something want enabled anyways.\r\n\r\n2. Populating topic-data with an empty string. This would in principle not be the way the broker works now, so it is either something we enable in a boolean parameter like \"initialize : true\" or we change the behaviour, I would prefer to have it as a parameter choice.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following CoAP communication would then be possible:\r\n\r\nClient ---> Broker : one-shot topic creation\r\n```sh\r\n\u276f ./client.py -m POST coap://127.0.0.1:5683/ps --payload \"{\\\"topic-name\\\": \\\"Room Temperature Sensor\\\", \\\"resource-type\\\": \\\"core.ps.conf\\\", \\\"media-type\\\": \\\"application/json\\\", \\\"topic-type\\\": \\\"temperature\\\", \\\"expiration-date\\\": \\\"2023-04-05T23:59:59Z\\\", \\\"max-subscribers\\\": 200, \\\"observer-check\\\": 86400, \\\"topic-data\\\": \\\"david-topic\\\", \\\"initialize\\\": true}\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nBroker ---> Client\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nResponse arrived from different address; base URI is coap://127.0.0.1/ps\r\nLocation options indicate new resource: /ps/4309ab\r\n\r\nJSON re-formated and indented\r\n{\r\n    \"topic-name\": \"Room Temperature Sensor\",\r\n    \"topic-data\": \"david-topic\",\r\n    \"resource-type\": \"core.ps.conf\",\r\n    \"media-type\": \"application/json\",\r\n    \"topic-type\": \"temperature\",\r\n    \"expiration-date\": \"2023-04-05T23:59:59Z\",\r\n    \"max-subscribers\": 200,\r\n    \"observer-check\": 86400,\r\n    \"initialize\": true\r\n}\r\n``````\r\nSubscriber ---> Broker : subscription before publication\r\n```sh\r\n\u276f ./client.py -m GET --observe 'coap://127.0.0.1:5683/david-topic'\r\nResponse arrived from different address; base URI is coap://127.0.0.1/david-topic\r\n```\r\nPublisher ---> Broker\r\n```sh\r\n\u276f ./client.py -m PUT coap://127.0.0.1:5683/david-topic --payload \"{\"n\": \"temperature\",\"u\": \"Cel\",\"t\": 1621452122,\"v\": 22}\"\r\nResponse arrived from different address; base URI is coap://127.0.0.1/david-topic\r\n{n: temperature,u: Cel,t: 1621452122,v: 22}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter which the client get the following notification\r\n\r\nSubscriber ---> Broker\r\n```sh\r\n\u276f ./client.py -m GET --observe 'coap://127.0.0.1:5683/david-topic'\r\nResponse arrived from different address; base URI is coap://127.0.0.1/david-topic\r\n\r\n---\r\n{n: temperature,u: Cel,t: 1621452122,v: 22}\r\n```",
